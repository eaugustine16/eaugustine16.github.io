          <h2>Daily Wake Up Call</h2>
          <p>If I received a grade for waking up in the morning, it would probably be a 'D', or a 'C-' at the very best. One year, you and Amma went on a mission to buy me an alarm clock. You asked the store clerk for the loudest alarm clock they had, and we walked out of that store with an obnoxiously loud alarm clock that had the power to wake up the entire city. Day one was met with great success, I woke up by myself. The novelty wore off a little too soon, by day two you and/or Amma had to take charge of that alarm clock.
          This because a pretty big concern when I left for college, and an especially big concern when I started working at Deloitte. Appa, thank you for your countless wake up calls day after day to make sure I was up and at work on time. It was a wonderful way to get up and get ready for the day.</p>

          <h2>School Drop-off/Pick-up</h2>
          <p>As a child, you take for granted the millions of things parents do on a day to day basis. I think about how you would drop me off and pick me up from school everyday. Now, I can imagine how much extra effort that was in the day (especially to come back from the office for the pick up). But, my daily update was a very important part of my day. This is when I would sit in the middle in the back seat in the car and lean forward with my head right between you and Amma to tell you every single thing about my school day.</p>

          <h2>Cheesy Omlettes</h2>
          <p>You are such a good sport about trying out new food and I've never heard you complain about any food that was made at home. In fact, I've only heard you say good things about food Amma makes. Well, I remember this one morning I decided to make omlettes with cheese as part of my morning cooking expedition. You were the lucky recipient of the first of my omlette masterpieces. You ate the whole omlette, which I took as a compliment to the chef. After you left for work, Amma and I ate a couple of omlettes that I made and, oh my goodness, there was SO MUCH CHEESE! I felt bad that you had to eat all that cheese (and I was worried about how much sodium I must have put into your body!).</p>

          <h2>Walkathon</h2>
          <p>So, I somehow missed the memo that it was not mandatory for parents to come to the school walkathon every year. I was SO excited and eager for any excuse to get you to school, I thought it must be mandatory. Thanks for taking extra time in the morning to come to the school walkathon... even when I was in 5th grade... and even when you saw that you were the only father that came to join his child in the school walkathon.Thanks for humoring me and for taking on all my requests.</p>
