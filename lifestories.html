          <h2>Daily Wake Up Call</h2>
          <p>If I received a grade for waking up in the morning, it would probably be a 'D', or a 'C-' at the very best. One year, you and Amma went on a mission to buy me an alarm clock. You asked the store clerk for the loudest alarm clock they had, and we walked out of that store with an obnoxiously loud alarm clock that had the power to wake up the entire city. Day one was met with great success, I woke up by myself. The novelty wore off a little too soon, by day two you and/or Amma had to take charge of that alarm clock.
          This because a pretty big concern when I left for college, and an especially big concern when I started working at Deloitte. Appa, thank you for your countless wake up calls day after day to make sure I was up and at work on time. It was a wonderful way to get up and get ready for the day.</p>

          <h2>School Drop-off/Pick-up</h2>
          <p>As a child, you take for granted the millions of things parents do on a daily basis. I think about how you would drop me off and pick me up from school everyday. I can only imagine how much effort that was in the day (especially to come back from the office). But, my daily update was a very important part of my day. This is when I would sit in the middle in the back seat of the car and lean forward with my head right between you and Amma to tell you every single thing about my school day.</p>

          <h2>Cheesy Omlettes</h2>
          <p>You are such a good sport about trying out new food and I've never heard you complain about any food that was made at home. In fact, I've only heard you say good things about food Amma makes. Well, I remember this one morning I decided to make omlettes with cheese as part of my morning cooking expedition. You were the lucky recipient of the first of my omlette masterpieces. You ate the whole omlette, which I took as a compliment to the chef. After you left for work, Amma and I ate a couple of omlettes that I made and, oh my goodness, there was SO MUCH CHEESE! I felt bad that you had to eat all that cheese (and I was worried about how much sodium I must have put into your body!).</p>

          <h2>Walkathon</h2>
          <p>So, I somehow missed the memo that it was not mandatory for parents to come to the school walkathon every year. I was SO excited and eager for any excuse to get you to school, I thought it must be mandatory. Thanks for taking extra time in the morning to come to the school walkathon... even when I was in 5th grade... and even when you saw that you were the only father that came to join his child in the school walkathon. Thanks for humoring me and for taking on all my requests.</p>

          <h2>World Traveler</h2>
          <p>Some of the most memorable experiences from my childhood are from our different adventures trekking the globe. I can't begin to imagine how you would plan international travel almost every other year without the internet! Booking tickets? Planning on what to do? Where to go? Where to stay? You must have done so, so much work to take our family on those trips. Travel, combined with going to AIS-R, shaped so much of who I am. Also, I loved how much you enjoyed being in a new country. Your excitement, happiness, and curiosity are contagious. Thank you taking me around the world.</p>

          <h2>Office Visits</h2>
          <p>I loved going to the office with you on Thursdays. My usual ritual included, going to the copy room and making photo copies of several things using the paper that had your name on the back (all those pages had a large 'Sunny Vareed' on the back'). Then I'd make the stop by kitchen area to eat and pack several sugar cubes. I also remember how the office smelled and how your desk was always super organized. I think I might have even played with some highlighters at your desk. That was some great father-daughter hangout time.</p>

          <h2>Paulooty</h2>
          <p>I love the relationship you have with Paul. You both have a wonderful connection and I love how much you have embraced him as your own son. I am so glad Paul gets to experience this unique kind of care and love. It's such a gift to get time together, all four of us. My favorite thing about that visit to LA is when you borrowed Paul's shirt and shoes to go strawberry picking. Those shoes were too big for you, but you wore them around that entire farm while we picked all those strawberries. It was so cute.</p>

          <h2>Amazing Work Ethic</h2>
          <p>You are an incredibly hard-working man. It inspires me and makes me proud have you as my father. I know it must not be easy, and there are times with a lot of pressure on your shoulders. But your work ethic is so rare and unique, and I have seen it throughout my life. Having just a few years of work experience, I'm starting to realize how much you've done in the part nearly 40 years. I mean, the fact that you can take and overnight flight and go straight to work... in your 60s! There are several 20 year-olds that struggle to do that! You're a machine, Appaji!</p>

          <h2>Includer</h2>
          <p>I recently took a strengths-finder test and one of my strengths is 'Includer'. Here is a description of the strength, Includer: "Stretch the circle wider." This is the philosophy around which you orient your life. You want to include people and make them feel part of the group. In direct contrast to those who are drawn only to exclusive groups, you actively avoid those groups that exclude others. You want to expand the group so that as many people as possible can benefit from its support. You hate the sight of someone on the outside looking in. You want to draw them in so that they can feel the warmth of the group.
          This strength comes from you. You are incredibly caring, and I see that it pains you to see someone else in pain or suffering. It's something you think about and carry with you to try and make better. I've seen this in the way you've taken on and helped solve so many of our friends' and family members' challenges. But I also have seen this in even little things, like when we used to go to Nawadar in Riyadh, you would take a lot of time to chat with our waiter and ask him about his life and living conditions. It's a beautiful part of who you are, Appa.</p>

          <h2>A Man of Integrity</h2>
          <p>One of the things I admire most about you, Appa, is your integrity. I don't think I've told you about this as much, but I have learned so much from your example in demonstrating integrity. I remember two clear instances in which you pointed out a mistake to the store clerk. One time was when we were shopping and the clerk forgot to charge us for a dress, you went back and paid for the dress. Another instance happened in Bahrain when the store clerk gave you SR2500 instead of SR250. You returned the money and as we walked out, you said that a mistake like that could have cost the store clerk her job. Those were incredibly powerful examples that I think about when I encounter a similar situation in my life. There are several other instances in which I know you had to make a really tough choice, and every time you've made the difficult move to value integrity above all else.</p>
